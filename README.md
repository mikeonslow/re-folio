A simple project that helped me in learning more about the [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/) language. I based this on a previous app that I created for an "Intro to Elm" workshop [https://github.com/mikeonslow/elm-workshop](https://github.com/mikeonslow/elm-workshop).

Thanks to the contributors on (the excellent) [reason-react-example](https://github.com/reasonml-community/reason-react-example) and also [@jaredly](https://github.com/jaredly) for this really excellent tutorial: [https://jaredforsyth.com/posts/a-reason-react-tutorial](https://jaredforsyth.com/posts/a-reason-react-tutorial). Both we're a big help to getting me started!

Run this project:

```
npm install
npm start
# in another tab
npm run webpack
```

After you see the webpack compilation succeed (the `npm run webpack` step), open up the nested html files in `src/*` (**no server needed!**). Then modify whichever file in `src` and refresh the page to see the changes.
